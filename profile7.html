<h1>Timely Warning</h1>
<p>Timely Warning
The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus
Crime Statistics Act requires all universities and colleges that receive
federal financial aid to keep campus crime statistics and security
information and make them available to the public. While I believe
this statute to have a positive impact on the transparency and
prevalence of instances of rape and sexual assault, the way Purdue
University shares this information is not helpful and obscures the
intent. Is it to draw attention to the crimes? Is it to tell students to
not typically go to the police immediately.
The most egregious aspect of these emails is the prevention tips that
to victims of these crimes, and many of them make absolutely no
sense. A tip such as, “define your sexual limits and practice being
assertive about your boundaries,” as if the perpetrator of these
kinds of crimes cares about your boundaries as if there was merely
some misunderstanding between the predator and the victim. This
is gross. Since when are rapists willing to listen to your limits? That
is exactly what makes them rapists. These emails do nothing to help
stop the toxic culture that created this problem in the first place and
rely on the same old tired argument that if only victims were more
vigilant, they would not have been targeted.
